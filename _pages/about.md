Hello! I am a PhD student at the University of British Columbia, supervised by Professor Claire Kremen. My research addresses the behavioral responses (foraging, dispersal, colony productivity/turnover) of bumble bees in response to landscape-scale agricultural diversification, as well as risks/rewards associated with these behaviors (diet composition, pesticide exposure). Broadly speaking, I hope to learn which factors allow pollinators to persist (or not) in agricultural landscapes and how these parameters are related to land management. Prior to beginning my PhD at UBC, I received a B.S. in biological engineering at MIT, and enjoy using my molecular biology background to address applied ecological questions.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
